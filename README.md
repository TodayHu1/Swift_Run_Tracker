# Swift_Run_Tracker
A basic app to track the runs I've completed, my distance, time, &amp; pace

Run Tracker allows users to save the runs they've completed in the past, along with the kms/minute calculated for the user.

The data is stored using CoreData.

Feel free to pull this down and play with it :).
